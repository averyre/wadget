# wadget
A multi-platform CLI /idgames client for downloading Doom addons quickly.

Written by Avery Ross using Python3 and the /idgames API.

### Purpose
Ever since using Linux on the daily I've fallen in love with the command line. Package managers from the CLI have been a godsend for installing software, so I decided to try and port the idea to Doom addons.

Doom was a game I fell in love with as a kid, and with this CLI tool you can easily download and search for new levels and files from the /idgames archive as you would apt-get or any other packaging solution. Of course it is a work in progress, but I hope it comes in handy!

### Install
Firstly, clone or download the git repository and navigate to it within a terminal. You MUST have Python3 and pip (3, if necessary to specify on your OS) installed for wadget to function.

Simply run this command from within the root wadget directory:
```
$ pip3 install .
```
You can now use wadget from the command line.

PyPi carries the latest "stable" release of wadget:
```
$ pip3 install wadget
```
wadget uses Python3, so you must specify pip3 if necessary on your system.

### Usage
To get started with basic usage, we can download Community Chest 3 to the working directory using:
```
$ wadget cchest3
```
If we wanted to search for all Community Chest files, or get a specific file ID for download, we can use the -s flag:
```
$ wadget cchest -s
```
This will return:

Use "wadget <FILE ID>" to download.

```
Which provides us with our file ID that can be used as an alternative method to download. Multiple file results can also be displayed at the same time. This method is useful if wadget is downloading the wrong file using a filename.

More specific search features will be introduced later!
